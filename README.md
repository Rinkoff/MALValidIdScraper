# MALValidIdScraper

This repository contains the valid url ids from MAL in the form of text files.
Note that this app's URLs are constantly changing and data may already be out of date.
The project includes automated scripts with which you can get the current valid IDs, as well as the valid IDs according to their genres.
The data is taken using the jikanpy package, and written to comply with the generation limit of the jikan api.
They can be converted to your needs.
